# elastic_bean_python_sample_app

The main branch is for those who knows the setup and the second branch is for those needs instant setup. 
Once you are done with cloning it - use eb-cli (recommended) to create env with python3.7 or later in us-east-1 (depends on your req) but just for testing. 

Thanks, Goodluck
